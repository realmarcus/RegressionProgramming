## OBJECTIVE:
In the wake of the Great Recession of 2009, there has been a good deal of focus on employment statistics, one of the most important metrics policymakers use to gauge the overall strength of the economy. In the United States, the government measures unemployment using the Current Population Survey (CPS), which collects demographic and employment information from a wide range of Americans each month. In this exercise, we will employ the topics reviewed in the lectures as well as a few new techniques using the September 2013 version of this rich, nationally representative dataset (available online).

http://thedataweb.rm.census.gov/ftp/cps_ftp.html

The observations in the dataset represent people surveyed in the September 2013 CPS who actually completed a survey. While the full dataset has 385 variables, in this exercise we will use a more compact version of the dataset, CPSData.csv, which has the following variables:
PeopleInHousehold: The number of people in the interviewee's household.
Region: The census region where the interviewee lives.
State: The state where the interviewee lives.
MetroAreaCode: A code that identifies the metropolitan area in which the interviewee lives (missing if the interviewee does not live in a metropolitan area). The mapping from codes to names of metropolitan areas is provided in the file MetroAreaCodes.csv.
Age: The age, in years, of the interviewee. 80 represents people aged 80-84, and 85 represents people aged 85 and higher.
Married: The marriage status of the interviewee.
Sex: The sex of the interviewee.
Education: The maximum level of education obtained by the interviewee.
Race: The race of the interviewee.
Hispanic: Whether the interviewee is of Hispanic ethnicity.
CountryOfBirthCode: A code identifying the country of birth of the interviewee. The mapping from codes to names of countries is provided in the file CountryCodes.csv.
Citizenship: The United States citizenship status of the interviewee.
EmploymentStatus: The status of employment of the interviewee.
Industry: The industry of employment of the interviewee (only available if they are employed).

## LOADING AND SUMMARIZING THE DATASET 
Load the dataset from CPSData.csv into a data frame called CPS, and view the dataset with the summary() and str() commands.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```
What is the local language?
```{r}
Sys.getlocale()
```
What is the local language?
```{r}
Sys.getlocale()
```
Change the local to English
```{r}
Sys.setlocale("LC_ALL","English")
```

```{r}
data <- read.csv("../data/CPSData.csv")
CPS <- tbl_df(data) 
```
How many interviewees are in the dataset?
```{r}
str(CPS)
```

Among the interviewees with a value reported for the Industry variable, what is the most common industry of employment? Please enter the name exactly how you see it.

```{r}
sort(summary(CPS$Industry))
```

Recall from the homework assignment "The Analytical Detective" that you can call the sort() function on the output of the table() function to obtain a sorted breakdown of a variable. For instance, sort(table(CPS$Region)) sorts the regions by the number of interviewees from that region.

Which state has the fewest interviewees?
Which state has the largest number of interviewees?

Method 1:
```{r}
sort(table(CPS$State))
```

What proportion of interviewees are citizens of the United States?
Method1
```{r}
table(CPS$Citizenship)
(116639+7073)/(116639+7073+7590)
```

The CPS differentiates between race (with possible values American Indian, Asian, Black, Pacific Islander, White, or Multiracial) and ethnicity. A number of interviewees are of Hispanic ethnicity, as captured by the Hispanic variable. 

For which races are there at least 250 interviewees in the CPS dataset of Hispanic ethnicity? (Select all that apply.)

```{r}
table(CPS$Race,CPS$Hispanic)
```

# EVALUATING MISSING VALUES 
Which variables have at least one interviewee with a missing (NA) value? (Select all that apply.)

```{r}
summary(CPS)
```

Often when evaluating a new dataset, we try to identify if there is a pattern in the missing values in the dataset. We will try to determine if there is a pattern in the missing values of the Married variable. The function is.na(CPS$Married) returns a vector of TRUE/FALSE values for whether the Married variable is missing. We can see the breakdown of whether Married is missing based on the reported value of the Region variable with the function table(CPS$Region, is.na(CPS$Married)). Which is the most accurate:

```{r}
 table(CPS$Region, is.na(CPS$Married))
```
The Married variable being missing is related to the Age value for the interviewee

```{r}
table(CPS$Age, is.na(CPS$Married))
```
For each possible value of Region, Sex, and Citizenship, there are both interviewees with missing and non-missing Married values. However, Married is missing for all interviewees Aged 0-14 and is present for all interviewees aged 15 and older. This is because the CPS does not ask about marriage status for interviewees 14 and younger.

As mentioned in the variable descriptions, MetroAreaCode is missing if an interviewee does not live in a metropolitan area. Using the same technique as in the previous question, answer the following questions about people who live in nonmetropolitan areas.

How many states had all interviewees living in a non-metropolitan area (aka they have a missing MetroAreaCode value)? For this question, treat the District of Columbia as a state (even though it is not technically a state).
How many states had all interviewees living in a metropolitan area? Again, treat the District of Columbia as a state.


```{r}
table(CPS$State,is.na(CPS$MetroAreaCode))
```

Which region of the United States has the largest proportion of interviewees living in a non-metropolitan area?

```{r}
table(CPS$Region,is.na(CPS$MetroAreaCode))
```
